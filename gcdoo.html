					<h2 id="class1">What is Stanley's Galazy?</h2>
					<hr/>
				
					<p> My <a href="https://github.com/zoywongus" target="_blank">projects</a> are nothing much at the moment. I enjoy non coding stuff these days. My Github and the 'projects' in it are kind of scraps of my past.</p>
					<hr/>
					
					<h1 id="thegcd">
						I started Stanley's Galazy as a personal website in 2018. It is iterated every other year.
					</h1>

					<p>
						In the first Stanley's Galazy, I was in the reading week of my first year of university (~6 months in).
						<br/>
						I still was in the co-op (internship) job hunt. I never did html/css before but wanted a nice personal website.
						<br/>
						So that's what I decided to do. I based it off a Youtube tutorial. And I also wanted to make it like a typical
						university one (but of course super basic UI and all), which includes my accomplishments and goals and whatnot.
						<br/>
						Given the fact it is on 'lebronjames.netlify.com' It was not meant to be really serious.

					<p>
						In the second Stanley's Galazy, I decided it needed an update after ~2 years. Given so much has changed, along with being in the middle of the pandemic, there were tons of things to update there.
						<br/>
						I had 3 internships, all of which were cool and learning and nice and fun. Could've been a 4th, but it got cancelled (postponed).
						<br/>
						It was an interesting summer. I was cooking a lot, exercising a lot, Rubik's Cubing a lot, etc etc. But I got a minor knee hiccup. So I guess that spiralled into more random time where I remembered to update my personal website.
						<br/>
						The interface from the OG personal website was cool enough for the interface to mostly remain the same. Some thematic overhauls was all it needed. Still kept the old site and put this in a new URL since it is cool to look back in the future the progress of my personal website.
						<br/>
						I guess around this point in time I realized that I couldn't 'fake' an interest in tech and coding stuff anymore. Like it's still cool and nice and fun and all. But I am not really motivated to do AI out of the blue or random projects specifically. Like, I'm fine with where I'm at.
						Not really too ambitious at the moment with tech-related stuff. In the past it seemed a bit fake deep inside. Mostly because I need to improve my skills/resume. 
					</p>
					<img src='img/galazy2.png' height='350' alt='Galazy 2'/>
					<p>
						I plan/hope to continue updating my personal website every 2 years. It seems to be a good interval where I can reflect and update my achievement, purpose, etc. If I plan a major UI overall, then I will have another personal website. That website won't be Stanley's Galazy.
						<br/> Stanley's Galazy will always remain to be this chunk of pure html/css :)
					</p>

						<br />
						<br />I feel a lot more authentic these days. But still a bit trash since authentic me is super boring. 
						Not much direct goals or ambitions resulting in me acting like a sloth. Wow.
